====================
Renew a subscription
====================

The key feature of a subscription business model is the recurring nature of payments. In this model,
customers pay a recurring amount in exchange for access to a product or a service. For example,
Odoo customers pay a monthly or annual subscription fee for access to Odoo.

The renewal of a subscription is the process followed by each customer when willing to pursue
their subscription. Indeed, each subscriber experiences this renewal process monthly, annually or
sometimes more, depending on the duration of the contract.

Most subscription companies choose to automate their renewal processes, but in some cases, manual
subscription renewals are still the preferred option.

With **Odoo Subscriptions**, you can have all your subscriptions in one application, suggest to your
customers an automatic subscription renewals as a manual one and finally, filter all your
subscriptions and easily find those to renew (with the help of our amazing tag *To renew*).
